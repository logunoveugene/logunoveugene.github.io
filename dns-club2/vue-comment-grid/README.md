Believe me, i wanted zero config usage for you but for **security reasons** some steps need to be setting up manually by you.

### Creating Firebase Project

Create new project in firebase console.

If you don't know how to create new project see detailed [here.](https://github.com/TugayYaldiz/vue-comment-grid/blob/master/docs/creating-database.md) 

### Setting Up Sign-In Method

Enable Email/Password method under Firebase Authentication menu. 

If you don't know how to enable Email/Password sign-in method see detailed [here.](https://github.com/TugayYaldiz/vue-comment-grid/blob/master/docs/set-sign-methods.md) 

### Getting Base URL and API Key

Get databaseURL and apiKey from Firebase. 

You can find Firebase databaseURL and apiKey in web setup under authentication menu from Firebase console.

If you don't know how to get there see detailed [here.](https://github.com/TugayYaldiz/vue-comment-grid/blob/master/docs/get-base-url-api-key.md) 

### Creating Database Node Name

For **security reasons** you need to create node names manually by yourself. Before passing new nodeName for different pages be sure you created that node name in database. 

If you adding your first node name add `Name: commentsGrid/nodeNameYouWant/active Value: true ` under Realtime Database Root.

For other node names that you will create add `Name: nodeNameYouWant/active Value: true` under `commentsGrid` .

If you don't know how to do this see detailed [here.](https://github.com/TugayYaldiz/vue-comment-grid/blob/master/docs/creating-database-node-name.md) 

### Setting Up Database Rules

Set Realtime Database Rules to [this.](https://github.com/TugayYaldiz/vue-comment-grid/blob/master/docs/database-rules.md)

If you don't know how to change database rules see detailed  [here.](https://github.com/TugayYaldiz/vue-comment-grid/blob/master/docs/database-rules-tutorial.md)

### Giving Yourself Admin Permission

After setting up database rules, you have everything that you need. Pass required values as props to component and run system.

First sign up as a normal user in the comment system then find yourself under `commentUsers` node in Firebase Database and add new child `Name: admin Value: true` there.

If you want to give more people admin permission just add them  `admin: true` child too.

If you don't know how to do this see detailed [here.](https://github.com/TugayYaldiz/vue-comment-grid/blob/master/docs/giving-yourself-admin.md)

### Changing Name or Comment Length Props

The default max user name length is "30" and default max comment length is "1000" character long. If you want change this values then you need to change values from Firebase Rules too.

## Why i did this plugin?

I wanted to learn the CSS Grid and combine it with the technologies i already know. So i came up with this idea. I loved CSS Grid so much and definitely recommend you to use it.
